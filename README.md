## Flight recommendation POC with AI
This project delivers a comprehensive Travel Recommendation Engine POC that goes beyond traditional sorting algorithms. It leverages Artificial Intelligence and Behavioral Data to provide personalized flight and hotel suggestions.

Key Achievements:

* Hybrid Recommendation Logic: Combines hard rules (Guest) with historical behavioral analysis (Logged-in).
* Semantic Search (Natural Language): Supports queries like "morning flights under $500" by parsing natural language intents into structured filtering limits.
* Explainable AI (XAI): Integrated Google Gemini 3.0 to provide natural language reasons for recommendations.
* Hotel Integration: Offers context-aware hotel recommendations at the destination, strictly ranked by quality.
